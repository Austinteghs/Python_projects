# Project Title: BMI Prediction and Visualization Tool

## Project Description:
This Python project provides an in-depth analysis of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on height, weight, and gender. It encompasses various data analysis techniques, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualization, machine learning modeling, and prediction. The primary objective of this project is to offer insights into BMI distribution and its implications for health, as well as providing a predictive tool for assessing an individual's health status based on their BMI.

## Analysis Overview:
- **Data Preprocessing**: The project begins with loading and preprocessing the dataset, which involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA is performed to understand the distribution of BMI and its relationship with other variables such as height, weight, and gender. Various visualization techniques, including scatter plots, histograms, and pie charts, are used to explore the data.
- **Machine Learning Modeling**: A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the preprocessed data to predict health status based on BMI. The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
- **Optimization**: The optimal number of trees for the Random Forest Classifier is determined using a grid search approach to maximize accuracy.
- **Health Status Prediction**: A function is developed to predict an individual's health status based on their gender, height, and weight. This function utilizes the trained machine learning model to provide actionable insights.

## Techniques Used:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding, and scaling numerical features using StandardScaler.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Utilizing seaborn and matplotlib libraries for visualizing data distribution, correlations, and categorical variables.
- **Machine Learning Modeling**: Implementing a Random Forest Classifier using scikit-learn library for predicting health status based on BMI.
- **Optimization**: Conducting a grid search to find the optimal hyperparameters for the Random Forest Classifier.
- **Health Status Prediction**: Developing a function to predict an individual's health status based on their BMI using the trained machine learning model.

## Conclusion:
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of BMI using data science techniques, including data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning modeling. By leveraging these techniques, the project offers valuable insights into BMI distribution and provides a predictive tool for assessing an individual's health status based on their BMI.
